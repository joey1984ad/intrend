# Facebook API Approval Fix Guide

## The Problem
Facebook rejected your app because:
- ❌ **No successful API calls** in the last 15 days
- ❌ **High error rate** for Ads API calls
- ❌ **Missing real API integration**

## The Solution
We need to make real Facebook API calls to demonstrate proper integration.

## Step 1: Get Your Facebook App Credentials

### 1.1 Get Your App ID and Secret
1. Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Select your app
3. Go to **Settings** → **Basic**
4. Copy your **App ID** and **App Secret**

### 1.2 Get an Access Token
1. Go to [Facebook Graph Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
2. Select your app from the dropdown
3. Click **Get Token** → **Get User Access Token**
4. Add these permissions:
   - ✅ `ads_read`
   - ✅ `ads_management` 
   - ✅ `read_insights`
   - ✅ `pages_read_engagement`
   - ✅ `business_management`
   - ✅ `pages_show_list`
5. Click **Generate Access Token**
6. Copy the generated token

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment

### 2.1 Update Your .env File
Create/update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Facebook App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id_here
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret_here
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_generated_access_token_here

# Optional: Facebook App Domain (for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
```

### 2.2 Test Your Configuration
Run the Facebook API test:

```bash
npm run test:facebook
```

## Step 3: Fix the FacebookRequestError

### 3.1 The Error You're Seeing
```
FacebookRequestError: Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
```

### 3.2 Common Causes and Solutions

#### **Cause 1: Incorrect SDK Initialization**
**Solution:** The API routes have been updated to handle both initialization methods.

#### **Cause 2: Missing Permissions**
**Solution:** Ensure your app has these permissions:
- `ads_read`
- `ads_management`
- `read_insights`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `business_management`
- `pages_show_list`

#### **Cause 3: Invalid Access Token**
**Solution:** 
1. Generate a fresh access token
2. Make sure it has the required permissions
3. Check that the token hasn't expired

#### **Cause 4: App Configuration Issues**
**Solution:**
1. Verify your App ID is correct
2. Check that your app is in the correct mode (development/live)
3. Ensure all required products are added

## Step 4: Make Real API Calls

### 4.1 Run the Test Script
The test script will make these API calls:
- ✅ Get user info (`/me`)
- ✅ Get ad accounts (`/me/adaccounts`)
- ✅ Get insights for each account (`/{account_id}/insights`)
- ✅ Get campaigns for each account (`/{account_id}/campaigns`)

### 4.2 Expected Output
```
🔍 Testing Facebook API integration...
✅ Access token found
🔄 Trying direct initialization...
✅ Direct initialization successful

📊 Testing: Get user info...
✅ User info retrieved: Your Name

📊 Testing: Get ad accounts...
✅ Ad accounts retrieved: 2 accounts

📊 Testing: Get insights for first ad account...
✅ Insights retrieved: 30 records

🎉 Facebook API test completed successfully!
✅ Your app should now work with Facebook integration
```

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 5.1 "Permission denied" Error
**Check:**
- ✅ Permissions are added to your app
- ✅ Permissions are requested during OAuth
- ✅ App is properly configured

### 5.2 "Invalid access token" Error
**Check:**
- ✅ Token is fresh and not expired
- ✅ Token has required permissions
- ✅ App ID matches your configuration

### 5.3 "No ad accounts found" Error
**Check:**
- ✅ User has Facebook ad accounts
- ✅ User has granted ads_management permission
- ✅ Account is properly set up for advertising

### 5.4 "FacebookRequestError" Error
**Check:**
- ✅ SDK initialization is correct
- ✅ Access token is valid
- ✅ API endpoints are correct
- ✅ Permissions are granted

## Step 6: Daily Testing Routine

### 6.1 Run Daily Tests
```bash
# Run the test script daily
npm run test:facebook

# Check the output for any errors
# Fix any issues immediately
```

### 6.2 Monitor API Usage
1. Go to your Facebook App Dashboard
2. Check **Analytics** → **API Usage**
3. Monitor success rates and error rates
4. Ensure success rate is > 95%

## Step 7: Production Checklist

### 7.1 Before Going Live
- ✅ All permissions added to app
- ✅ OAuth redirect URIs configured
- ✅ App domains set for production
- ✅ HTTPS enforced
- ✅ Privacy policy and terms of service URLs set
- ✅ App reviewed and approved by Facebook

### 7.2 Security Settings
- ✅ App Secret Proof enabled
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement enabled
- ✅ Valid OAuth redirect URIs configured
- ✅ Rate limiting configured

## Step 8: Re-submission Preparation

### 8.1 After 15 Days of Successful API Calls
1. **Monitor API usage** for 15 consecutive days
2. **Ensure success rate** is > 95%
3. **Fix any errors** immediately
4. **Document all API calls** made during testing

### 8.2 Re-submit Your App
1. Go to your Facebook App Dashboard
2. Navigate to **App Review**
3. Re-submit your app for review
4. Include documentation of successful API usage

## Step 9: Advanced Debugging

### 9.1 Enable Detailed Logging
The updated API routes now include detailed error logging to help identify issues.

### 9.2 Check Network Tab
Monitor the browser's network tab to see:
- API request URLs
- Response status codes
- Error messages

### 9.3 Test with Graph Explorer
Use Facebook Graph Explorer to test API calls manually:
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
2. Select your app
3. Add required permissions
4. Test API endpoints manually

## Step 10: Success Metrics

Your app will be approved when:
- ✅ **All permissions** are properly configured
- ✅ **OAuth flow** works correctly
- ✅ **API calls** are successful (> 95% success rate)
- ✅ **Error rate** is low (< 5%)
- ✅ **Rate limits** are respected
- ✅ **15 days** of consistent successful API usage

**Remember:** Run `npm run test:facebook` daily for 15 days to build up successful API calls before re-submitting for review!
