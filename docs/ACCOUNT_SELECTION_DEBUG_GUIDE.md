# 🔧 Account Selection Debug Guide

## Issue
User reports: "I still can not see and select ad accounts from facebook in order to select and upgrade the plan for each"

## Debug Solution Implemented

I've added comprehensive debugging to track exactly what happens when you try to select Facebook ad accounts for subscription.

### 🔍 Debug Logging Added

#### 1. MetaDashboard - Choose Plan & Subscribe Button
When you click the **"Choose Plan & Subscribe"** button, watch for these logs:
```
🔵 MetaDashboard: Choose Plan & Subscribe clicked
🔵 MetaDashboard: facebookAdAccounts: X
🔵 MetaDashboard: Setting allAdAccounts and showing selector
```

#### 2. AdAccountSelector Modal
When the modal should appear, watch for these logs:
```
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Received adAccounts: X
🔵 AdAccountSelector: isVisible: true/false
🔵 AdAccountSelector: adAccounts data: [...]
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Render check - isVisible: true, adAccounts: X
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Initialized with accounts: [...]
```

#### 3. PerAccountBillingManager Debug Panel
In the yellow debug panel, check:
```
🔍 PerAccountBillingManager Debug:
📊 Total Facebook ad accounts: X
📊 Available accounts for adding: X
```

## 🎯 How to Test & Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Clear the console** (click trash icon)

### Step 2: Navigate to Accounts Tab
1. **Go to**: Dashboard → Accounts tab
2. **Check**: Do you see the "Choose Plan & Subscribe" button?
3. **Look for**: The section that says "Facebook Connected! Choose Your Ad Accounts"

### Step 3: Click "Choose Plan & Subscribe"
1. **Click the button**
2. **Watch console immediately** for the debug logs
3. **Check**: Does the account selection modal appear?

### Step 4: Check Debug Information
Look in console for any of these patterns:

#### ✅ **Expected Success Pattern:**
```
🔵 MetaDashboard: Choose Plan & Subscribe clicked
🔵 MetaDashboard: facebookAdAccounts: 2
🔵 MetaDashboard: Setting allAdAccounts and showing selector
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Received adAccounts: 2
🔵 AdAccountSelector: isVisible: true
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Render check - isVisible: true, adAccounts: 2
🔵 AdAccountSelector: Initialized with accounts: ["act_123", "act_456"]
```

#### ❌ **Problem Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: No Facebook Accounts**
```
🔵 MetaDashboard: facebookAdAccounts: 0
```
**Solution**: Use the "🔄 Refresh Facebook Accounts" button in debug panel

**Pattern 2: Modal Not Showing**
```
🔵 AdAccountSelector: isVisible: false
```
**Solution**: Check if React state is being set correctly

**Pattern 3: No Debug Logs at All**
**Solution**: Button click handler might not be working

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Choose Plan & Subscribe" Button Missing
**Look for**: Facebook connection section
**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're connected to Facebook

### Issue 2: Button Doesn't Respond
**Check console for**: Any JavaScript errors
**Solutions**:

### Issue 4: Modal Appears But Empty
**Check console for**: Account data structure
**Solutions**:

## 📊 What You Should See

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Accounts tab**: Shows "Facebook Connected!" section with subscribe button
2. **Click button**: Account selection modal opens immediately
3. **Modal content**: Shows list of your Facebook ad accounts with checkboxes

### Next Steps After Account Selection:
1. **Plan selector modal**: Choose Basic ($10) or Pro ($20) plan
