- **Examples**: Phase transitions, successful operations, timing data
- **Action**: Usually no action needed, just informational

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (Yellow)
- **Purpose**: Non-critical issues that might affect functionality
- **Examples**: Missing optional data, fallback operations
- **Action**: Review and address if functionality is affected

### ‚ùå ERROR (Red)
- **Purpose**: Critical issues that prevent successful analysis
- **Examples**: Network failures, missing required data, configuration errors
- **Action**: Immediate attention required to resolve the issue

## üîç Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Webhook URL Not Configured
**Symptoms**: 
- Environment Check shows "‚ùå Not configured" for Webhook URL
- AI analysis fails immediately

**Solutions**:
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` to your environment variables
- Ensure the URL is accessible from your application
- Verify the n8n workflow is running and accessible

### 2. Facebook Token Missing
**Symptoms**:
- Environment Check shows "‚ùå Not available" for Facebook Token
- Cannot access creative data

**Solutions**:
- Re-authenticate with Facebook
- Check if the token has expired
- Verify the token has required permissions

### 3. Creative Data Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Environment Check shows "‚ùå Missing" for Ad Account ID
- AI analysis fails during validation

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the creative has a valid `adAccountId` field
- Check if the creative data is properly loaded
- Verify the creative has valid image URLs

### 4. Network Timeouts
**Symptoms**:
- Analysis hangs for more than 30 seconds
- Error message mentions timeout

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the n8n webhook is responding
- Check if the webhook URL is accessible
- Review n8n workflow performance

### 5. Invalid Response Format
**Symptoms**:
- Warning about "Webhook response is not valid JSON"
- Analysis completes but with unexpected results

**Solutions**:
- Check the n8n workflow output format
- Ensure the webhook returns valid JSON
- Verify the response structure matches expected format

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Understanding Performance Metrics
- **Validation Time**: Time spent validating creative data
- **Network Time**: Time for webhook request/response
- **Processing Time**: Time to parse and process response
- **Total Time**: Complete end-to-end analysis time

### Performance Targets
- **Validation**: < 100ms
- **Network**: < 5000ms (5 seconds)
- **Processing**: < 100ms
- **Total**: < 6000ms (6 seconds)

### Optimization Tips
1. **Enable Debug Mode** to identify slow phases
2. **Monitor Network Time** for webhook performance issues
3. **Check Response Size** for large payloads
4. **Review Phase Timing** to identify bottlenecks

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Debugging

### Console Logging
All debug information is also logged to the browser console with:
- Structured formatting
- Expandable groups
- Color-coded levels
- Performance data

### Log Export
Use the "Export Logs" button to:
- Download complete log history
- Share logs with support teams
- Analyze logs in external tools
- Archive debugging sessions

### Session Tracking
Each analysis attempt gets a unique session ID:
- Format: `session_{creativeId}_{timestamp}_{randomId}`
- Used to correlate logs across components
- Helps track issues across multiple attempts

## üîß Developer Tools

### Browser Console Commands
```javascript
// Enable debug mode programmatically
window.setDebugMode(true);

// Get all logs
window.getAllLogs();

// Get logs for specific session
window.getSessionLogs('session_123_456_abc');

// Clear all logs
window.clearLogs();

// Export logs
window.exportLogs();
```

### Network Tab Analysis
1. Open Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Start AI analysis
3. Look for the webhook request
4. Check request/response details
5. Verify timing and status codes

### Error Stack Traces
- Full error stack traces are logged when available
- Use browser console to view complete error details
- Stack traces help identify the exact source of issues
