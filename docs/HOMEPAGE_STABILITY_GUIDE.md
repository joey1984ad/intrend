# Homepage Stability Guide

## Problem Identified

Your homepage changes were getting "reverted" because they were **uncommitted changes** in your working directory. When you restarted your development server or had file watching issues, Next.js was pulling from the committed version instead of your local changes.

## Root Causes

1. **Uncommitted Changes**: Homepage improvements were in working directory but not committed to git
2. **Development Server Restarts**: Dev server pulls from committed version when restarted
3. **File Watching Issues**: Next.js file watching might not detect changes properly
4. **Git Branch Management**: Working on feature branch without proper commit workflow

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Committed All Changes âœ…
- **Homepage Redesign**: Complete modern UI overhaul with new sections
- **Pricing Structure**: Updated plan names and features
- **Billing Components**: Enhanced billing page and Stripe integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and setup instructions

### 2. Git Workflow Best Practices
```bash
# Always commit your changes before stopping work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Describe your changes"

# Check status before stopping
git status

# Push to remote to backup your work
git push origin Stripe-I
```

### 3. Development Server Stability
```bash
# Use these commands to ensure stability
npm run dev          # Start dev server
# Make changes to files
git add .            # Stage changes
git commit -m "..."  # Commit changes
# Restart dev server if needed - changes will persist
```

## Prevention Checklist

### Before Stopping Work
- [ ] Check `git status` for uncommitted changes
- [ ] Stage all changes with `git add .`
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to remote branch for backup

### Development Best Practices
- [ ] Work on feature branches (like `Stripe-I`)
- [ ] Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- [ ] Test changes in development before committing
- [ ] Keep documentation updated

### File Monitoring
- [ ] Ensure Next.js file watching is working
- [ ] Check for any build processes that might overwrite files
- [ ] Verify no scripts are auto-reverting changes

## Troubleshooting

### If Changes Still Revert
1. **Check Git Status**: `git status`
2. **Verify Commits**: `git log --oneline -5`
3. **Check Branch**: Ensure you're on correct branch
4. **File Permissions**: Verify file write permissions
5. **Development Server**: Restart with `npm run dev`

### Common Issues
- **File Locked**: Check if file is open in another editor
- **Permission Denied**: Run as administrator if needed
- **Git Conflicts**: Resolve any merge conflicts
- **Build Cache**: Clear Next.js cache if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Push Changes**: `git push origin Stripe-I`
2. **Test Homepage**: Verify all changes are working
3. **Monitor Stability**: Ensure changes persist across restarts
4. **Continue Development**: Follow commit workflow for future changes
