# üîß Billing Cycle Switch Fix

## Issue Description

**Problem**: When a user has a monthly subscription and tries to upgrade to an annual plan of the same tier, the button doesn't work because the system incorrectly identifies it as the "current plan".

**Example Scenario**:
- User has "Pro Plan" with monthly billing
- User wants to switch to "Pro Plan" with annual billing
- Button shows "Current Plan" and is disabled

## Root Cause

The original plan comparison logic only checked the plan ID without considering the billing cycle:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Problematic)
(subscription?.plan.id === plan.id || user?.currentPlanId === plan.id)
```

This meant that if a user had "Pro Plan" monthly, they couldn't upgrade to "Pro Plan" annual because the system thought they already had that plan.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Helper Function

Added a new helper function that considers both plan ID and billing cycle:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ AFTER (Fixed)
const isCurrentPlan = (planId: string, planBillingCycle: 'monthly' | 'annual') => {
  const currentPlanId = subscription?.plan.id || user?.currentPlanId;
  const currentBillingCycle = subscription?.billing_cycle || user?.currentBillingCycle;
  
  // Only consider it the same plan if both plan ID AND billing cycle match
  return currentPlanId === planId && currentBillingCycle === planBillingCycle;
};
```

### 2. Updated Plan Display Logic

Replaced all plan comparison logic with the new helper function:

```typescript
// Plan highlighting
className={`... ${
  isCurrentPlan(plan.id, billingCycle)
    ? 'border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20'
    : 'border-gray-200 dark:border-slate-700 hover:border-blue-300 dark:hover:border-blue-600'
}`}

// Current plan badge
{isCurrentPlan(plan.id, billingCycle) && (
  <span className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium">
    Current Plan
  </span>
)}

// Button logic
{isCurrentPlan(plan.id, billingCycle) ? (
  <button disabled className="...">Current Plan</button>
) : (
  <button onClick={() => handleUpgrade(plan.id, billingCycle)} className="...">
    {plan.currentPricing.price === 0 ? 'Downgrade to Free' : 
     (subscription?.plan.id === plan.id || user?.currentPlanId === plan.id) ? 
     `Switch to ${billingCycle === 'annual' ? 'Annual' : 'Monthly'}` : 
     'Upgrade Plan'}
  </button>
)}
```

### 3. Enhanced Button Text

Updated button text to be more descriptive when switching billing cycles:

- **Same plan, different cycle**: "Switch to Annual" or "Switch to Monthly"
- **Different plan**: "Upgrade Plan"
- **Free plan**: "Downgrade to Free"

### 4. Updated Modal Information

Enhanced the upgrade modal to show appropriate messaging:

```typescript
// Modal title
{isCurrentPlan(selectedPlan, selectedBillingCycle) ? 
  `Switch to ${selectedBillingCycle === 'annual' ? 'Annual' : 'Monthly'} Billing` :
  `Upgrade to ${PRICING_PLANS[selectedPlan as keyof typeof PRICING_PLANS]?.name}`
}

// Modal button
{isCurrentPlan(selectedPlan, selectedBillingCycle) ? 'Switch Billing Cycle' : 'Continue to Payment'}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Now Working:
1. **Monthly ‚Üí Annual**: User with Pro monthly can upgrade to Pro annual
2. **Annual ‚Üí Monthly**: User with Pro annual can switch to Pro monthly
3. **Different Plans**: User can upgrade from any plan to any other plan
4. **Free Plan**: User can downgrade to free plan

### üîç Test Cases:
1. **Pro Monthly ‚Üí Pro Annual**: Button should show "Switch to Annual"
2. **Pro Annual ‚Üí Pro Monthly**: Button should show "Switch to Monthly"
3. **Free ‚Üí Pro Monthly**: Button should show "Upgrade Plan"
4. **Pro Monthly ‚Üí Enterprise**: Button should show "Upgrade Plan"

## Files Modified

- `components/EnhancedBillingPage.tsx` - Main billing page component
  - Added `isCurrentPlan` helper function
  - Updated plan display logic
  - Enhanced button text and modal messaging

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can now easily switch between billing cycles
2. **Clear Messaging**: Button text clearly indicates the action
3. **Consistent Logic**: All plan comparisons use the same logic
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend for additional billing cycles
